Here we will use snpEff to annotate SNPs and predict their effect on genes and proteins.
We can directly use VCF files (containing either full dataset or just the BayPass outliers) as an input for snpEff. However, as we study non-model species, the annotation information of our studied species is not availabe in snpEff and we need to manually add our database to the program.
