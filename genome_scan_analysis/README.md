# Genome-wide scan analysis to detect outlier SNPs associated with invasiveness

Here we will use the recently developed C2 statistics <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/37/8/2369/5821433" title="(Olazcuaga et al 2020)">(Olazcuaga et al 2020)</a> implemented in <a href="http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/CBGP/software/baypass/" title="BayPass v2.3">BayPass v2.3</a> to identify outlier SNPs potentially associated with invasion success in the BMSB.
